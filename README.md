# dotfiles

My personal dotfiles repo, managed by the wonderful [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi)

As you can tell from the dotfiles, my main setup is Windows 11. I use WSL and DevContainers heavily, so having Windows, WSL, DevContainers, Linux, and all my servers use the same dotfiles makes my life easier. It's taken me a long time to finally get to the point of just sitting down and doing this. The other benefit is when using VSCode, I can now use the neovim extension and take advantage of all the goodness neovim offers with VSCode's LSP.
